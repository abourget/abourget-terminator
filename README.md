Simple Terminator plugin to kick-start my working session and allow me to
configure it *fast*.

I was tired of re-opening my tabs each time and starting my processes, so
I scripted my way out of it.

Copy the `TenscoresPlugin.py` into your `~/.config/terminator/plugins` directory
and activate it in the Terminator Preferences.

Then, you have a new menu item when you right-click on your terminal window.
Clicking it will setup your session like you want it.  Without having
to rename your windows, and launching your commands.

Customize at will.
